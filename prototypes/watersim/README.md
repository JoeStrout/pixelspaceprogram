# Simple prototype for the water simulation
Click somewhere to spawn a rock that falls and interact with the water.

# Why the Input.ms file?
It's a handy system to avoid extra boilerplate for single keypress, that way i can just call keyPressed(KEY) and it won't call the code every frame, for that i have the function keyDown(KEY)
